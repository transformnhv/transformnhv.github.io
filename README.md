#New Haven City Transformation Plan

##About the City Transformation Plan

Mayor Toni Harp has called upon the New Haven community to join together to promote New Haven as a City of Promise, Opportunity and Innovation—where everyone can succeed. To make that happen, we must build on what makes our city great: our incredible knowledge and service institutions, our diverse economy, and the people and neighborhoods that give our city its rich and diverse culture.

At the same time, we must acknowledge the unevenness of this City’s socioeconomic landscape. The New Haven story has long been a “tale of two cities” in which wealth, well-being and opportunity coincide with place, race, gender, age, and where a person was born. We have already begun to change that story by:
* Advancing our nationally recognized School Change initiative and reconnecting disconnected youth to educational opportunities through YouthSTAT
* Launching our Fresh Start initiative to provide a second chance to individuals returning to our community from incarceration
* Engaging employers to hire more New Haven residents
* Continuing to support grassroots action around the City to improve neighborhood conditions and bring neighbors together

In addition, in Fall 2014, 67 organizations came together with city agencies and other community partners to apply for designation as a federal Promise Zone. Prior to the submission of the Promise Zone application, Mayor Harp asked the City to seize the opportunity presented by the Promise Zone collaboration to design and implement a comprehensive, five-year, New Haven City Transformation Plan (CTP). In spring of 2015, we learned that our bid for the Promise Zone designation was not successful, although we were one of the top 10 finalists in the nation.

We proceeded with the CTP and many additional organizations signed on to this broader effort, committing to:
* Creating new partnerships for innovative solutions to social issues;
* Using data to be accountable to New Haven communities;
* Emphasizing equitable outcomes in all our work

Seven work groups met between March and June, 2015 to identify goals and strategies for the proposed CTP.

They focused on these eight areas:
* Workforce and Jobs
* Economic Activity
* Early Childhood
* Education and Positive Youth Development
* Community Cohesion and Safety
* Community Health, Mental Health, and Wellness
* Housing and Physical Environment
* Adult Literacy
